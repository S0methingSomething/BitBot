TUTORIAL: How to Customize This Post Template
---------------------------------------------
This file controls the format of the Reddit post. You can edit anything outside of this comment block.
The bot replaces placeholders (like {{version}}) with data from the config file and the release process.
This entire block, including these lines, will be removed by the script before posting.

Available Placeholders:
| Placeholder           | Description                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{version}}           | The new version number, like `4.2.0`.                          |
| {{direct_download_url}} | The direct link to download the patched asset file.            |
| {{bot_name}}          | The name of your bot (from `config.json`).                     |
| {{bot_repo}}          | Your bot's repository name, like `YourUsername/BitBot`.        |
| {{asset_name}}        | The name of the file asset, like `MonetizationVars`.           |
| {{creator_username}}  | The creator's Reddit username (from `config.json`).            |
